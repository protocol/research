## Scope

We expect all in attendance at PL Research events to respect this Code of Conduct at all times in all venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to PL Research.

This policy covers our website, PL Research related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of Protocol Labs Research. It also
applies to behavior in the context of our Open Source research communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, Slack channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the [PL Research Team](#contact-info).

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated. Questions or discussions during research seminars may be cut off by the host if they are judged to be distracting, not applicable to the rest of those in attendance, rude, combative, or offensive.

Harassing others is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment; harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please [contact us](#contact-info) to report the behavior. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the PL Research team may ban that individual from all future PL Research events without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the PL Research team. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Info

Please contact research@protocol.ai if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

We will keep all matters confidential and they will only be shared within the team, with the exception of legal counsel when deemed necessary, or unless given explicit permission by the reporter.

If you prefer, you can contact one of the below team members separately:

- jpgross (at] protocol [dot) ai
- miyazono (at] protocol [dot) ai
- karola [dot) kirsanow (at] protocol [dot) ai

When contacting an individual directly, they will ask for explicit permission to share the details with the rest of the team. When not granted, they will keep details of the matters as confidential as possible (particularly private or identity information) but they may still share broad strokes as necessary to resolve the issue.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
